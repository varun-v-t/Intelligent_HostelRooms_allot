# Hostel Room Selection
## Business Problem
In Colleges, every year so many students get enrolled to the courses. And many students opt-in for college hostels and also college makes it mandatory for students enroll into hostels. Hence it becomes important for hostel management to maintain the information about different rooms which are available and also information about students who are staying in different rooms. 
## Solution
With this tool, it makes it easy for college to maintain information about rooms in hostel and allocate rooms to different students. This also has a feature called "Profile Matching", where new 2-3 students are matched together based on the language they speak, where they belong from, etc and rooms are allocated for this grouped students. This makes it easier for students to share room with the ones they can feel comfortable with and spend college time peacefully :)
